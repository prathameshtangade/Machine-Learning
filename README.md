### 1 : Currency Exchange Rate : The aim is to predict INR-USD Currency Exchange Rate.
Currancy Exchange rate prediction is a regression problem in machine learning. Every day there are exchange rate fluctuations that can affect personal income, company income and even a country's economy. Predicting exchange rates can therefore benefit both individuals and countries in many ways.There are numerous machine learning algorithms that can be used to predict future exchange rates. Artificial neural networks can also be used for this task. This Project describes a machine learning exchange rate prediction task using Python.
